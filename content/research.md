### Overview

In mathematics, a common goal is to understand how to use established techniques and theory to help solve more complicated questions. [Representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory) is the study of understanding abstract algebraic objects through the lens of [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) by representing abstract elements as [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)). In effect, representation theory allows one to use techniques of linear algebra to understand far more complicated objects.

[Quantum algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algebra) is the area of mathematics that in some way relates to the fact that *noncommutativity* (that is, when $a \cdot b \neq b \cdot a$) is found in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics). Examples of noncommutative operations are division (e.g., $2 \div 5 \neq 5 \div 2$), subtraction (e.g., $8-3 \neq 3-8$), and [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication).

In the area of quantum algebra are special noncommutative objects known as [quantum groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_group), whose representation theories are known to have particular importance in quantum physics. One such family of quantum groups are called [Yangians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangian), which come equipped with the foundational fact that their representation theory produces rational solutions to the [quantum Yang-Baxter equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangâ€“Baxter_equation). The structure and representation theory of Yangians has become a study in and of itself, with such research expanding to *super* Yangians: a formulation of Yangians in terms of [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry). However, the theory of super Yangians is comparatively less developed to its non-super counterpart, which is the cause of further exploration.

<!-- ### In Detail

Given any finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, the Yangian $Y_{\hbar}(\mathfrak{g})$ is a unital associative $\mathbb{C}$-algebra depending on some ancillary parameter $\hbar$, which when specializing $\hbar$ to a certain complex number, becomes the universal enveloping algebra $\mathfrak{U}(\mathfrak{g}[z])$ of the polynomial current algebra $\mathfrak{g}[z]$. In short, the Yangian $Y_{\hbar}(\mathfrak{g})$ is a (Hopf) algebra deformation, or more accurately a homogeneous quantization, of $\mathfrak{U}(\mathfrak{g}[z])$.

Yangians are examples of affine quantum groups, meaning that they are (noncommutative and noncocommutative) pseudo-quasitriangular Hopf algebras. They were first formally introduced by V. Drinfel'd who named such in honour of the physicist C. N. Yang. However, these algebraic structures arose earlier in terms of their representations in mathematical physics within the context of [integrable quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_inverse_scattering_method).

$R_{12}(u_{1},u_{2})R_{13}(u_{1},u_{3})R_{23}(u_{2},u_{3})=R_{23}(u_{2},u_{3})R_{13}(u_{1},u_{3})R_{12}(u_{1},u_{2})$ -->
