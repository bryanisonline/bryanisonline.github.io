summary: We cover Yangains based on the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras.

abstract: Yangians form one of the two important families of affine quantum groups, alongside the Drinfel'd-Jimbo quantum affine algebras. Given a complex simple Lie algebra or non-exceptional basic Lie superalgebra {{< math >}}$\mathfrak{g}${{< /math >}}, the Yangian {{< math >}}$\operatorname{Y}(\mathfrak{g})${{< /math >}} is a certain Hopf algebra which is a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra {{< math >}}$U(\mathfrak{g}[z])${{< /math >}}. In this talk, we cover recent advancements made on the structure and representation theory of Yangians based on the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras.
